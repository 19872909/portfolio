## Hello, welcome to my portfolio profile.

<img align="left" width="250px" style="margin-top: 0px" src="./img/me-removebg.png" >

- 👨🏻‍🎓 B.E. in Chemical Engineering |State University of Maringá - UEM| 2016-2020.
- 🏅 Specialized in Artificial and Computational Intelligence |Federal University of Viçosa - UFV| 2023-2024.     
- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Data Scientist focusing on building predictive models for agribusiness.
- 🌱 I've been directing my studies towards statistics, in order to optimize the extraction of insights from mass data.
- 💬 We can talk about the entire development pipeline of predictive models using Python language.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His. 
- ⚡ Curiosity: I majored in Chemical Engineering at the end of 2020. Soon after, I started my journey in the chemical industry in the R & D sector, however
my passion for technology and data analysis started to speak louder (I have been using computer programming since 2016, solving engineering problems). So, I decided to enter the world of Data Science, starting in the BI/BA area and later going to work as a Data Scientist with a focus on the development and deployment of Machine Learning models.
