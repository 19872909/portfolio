Data Scientist with experience working on cross-functional teams to implement effective data solutions, develop data governance policies, and leverage advanced analytics for valuable insights

I am currently studying Behavioral Data Science at the Universitat de Barcelona, where I delve into the intersection of data analysis, psychology, and behavioral economics. This program sharpens my advanced data analysis skills using R and Python, enhancing my expertise in statistical modeling, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization. The psychological component of the curriculum focuses on psychographics, behavior prediction through psychometrics, and behavioral modeling, empowering me to develop AI solutions tailored to human behavior. This academic journey has reinvigorated my professional enthusiasm and significantly improved my ability to apply data science in more empathetic and effective ways.
